<h1>Memory Game</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I've built this site to showcase the work I've done through Udacity's FrontEnd Nanodegree Program with Google. This site is a game, the user finds a total of 8 pairs to win. The game reinforced event delegation as well as DOM manipulation.

<h2>Build Status</h2>
This project is completed.


<h2>Tech/Frameworks used</h2>

        <li>HTML & CSS</li>

    </ul>

<h2>How to Use?</h2>
Users can click to flip the cards, once all the cards are matched the user will receive their score and the option to play again.
